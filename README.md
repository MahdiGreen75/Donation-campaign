### 1. React.js

The project is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to create reusable UI elements and manage complex user interfaces efficiently.

### 2. React Router

We have implemented React Router to handle client-side routing within the application. This allows for smooth navigation between different views or pages without the need for a full page reload. Routes are defined and mapped to specific components, providing a seamless user experience.

### 3. Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is used for styling and layout in the project. It's a utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the design process by providing a set of pre-defined classes for common styles. This allows for rapid development and easy customization of the user interface.

### 4. Local Storage

Local storage is employed to persist user data locally in the browser. This ensures that user data is retained even after refreshing the page or closing the browser. Local storage is a key feature for enhancing the user experience by maintaining session data between visits.

### 5. Search Functionality

One of the project's standout features is its powerful search functionality. This feature is implemented using state management, which ensures real-time updates and efficient handling of search queries. Users can easily search for specific items or content within the application, making it user-friendly and efficient.

## Usage
